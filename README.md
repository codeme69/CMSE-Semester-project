# CMSE-Semester-project

## About the Project:

Analyze how to tackle misinformation on social-media.

We built an user class and a model class that resembles how users interact on real life social media.

We plan to build an algorithm that defines how to pass accurate information among users as fast and efficiently as possible. We build a model and use the algorithm to create a path between the user that has information and the user that needs that information. We are looking what is the best path with least amount of misinformation
when multiple senders are available.
We are planning to look at how the model performs with and without algorithm. We plan to build data vizualization plots like heatmaps to look at how misinformation spread.

Next, we want to  predict which sender can have an accurate inforamtion to make our model perform better. To accomplish that, we built a simple machine learning model that can predict the user's pattern of transmitting information. Some simple features (or variables) of user are chosen to develop the ML model. The model's performance is limited as of now as the values of features are random-based.


### How to run the code:

The code that needs to be executed is in the main.py file. This file requires you to download a library which is pre-loaded in model.py with the command. Just uncomment it, run the cell once and comment it again.


### Contributions

Sreeram: Developed the code for user and model classes and built the ML model as a part of team. Managed to bring ideas on how to make the program better in terms of performance and relevance.  Brainstormed ideas for the overall project development.

Sai: Worked on the development of the user and model. Also managed to create the analysis for the project. Brainstormed ideas for the overall project development.

Sanjana: Worked on delegating tasks to each member based on their abilities. Initiated the group meetings and created the slides.  Brainstormed ideas for the overall project development and worked on the user class code. 

Pranta: Helped to create the slides and contributed to the group meetings. Helped give out ideas for the model class code.

Jialin: Attended most of the group meetings and contributed to the slides. Did most of the design in the slides.
