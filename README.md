# CMSE-Semester-project

Analyze how to tackle misinformation on social-media.

Build an user class and a model class that contains users.

We plan to build an algorithm that defines how to pass accurate information among users as fast and efficiently as possible. We build a model and use the algorithm to create a path between the user that has information and the user that needs that information. 

We are going to look at how the model performs with and without algorithm. We plan to build data vizualization plots like heatmaps to look at how misinformation spread.
