## About the Project:

Analyze how to tackle misinformation on social-media.

We built an user class and a model class that resembles how users interact on real life social media.

We plan to build an algorithm that defines how to pass accurate information among users as fast and efficiently as possible. We build a model and use the algorithm to create a path between the user that has information and the user that needs that information. We are looking what is the best path with least amount of misinformation
when multiple senders are available.
We are planning to look at how the model performs with and without algorithm. We plan to build data vizualization plots like heatmaps to look at how misinformation spread.

Next, we want to  predict which sender can have an accurate inforamtion to make our model perform better. To accomplish that, we built a simple machine learning model that can predict the user's pattern of transmitting information. Some simple features (or variables) of user are chosen to develop the ML model. The model's performance is limited as of now as the values of features are random-based.


### How to run the code:

The code that needs to be executed is in the main.py file. This file requires you to download a library which is pre-loaded in model.py with the command. Just uncomment it, run the cell once and comment it again.
